Trying the Git commands with the CLI 

adding test to this file to see if I can pull it down to my local repo, change it, and push it back to the github repo

THIS TEXT WAS ADDED ON MY PC. 
I will try to now upload this to my github account.


SUCCESS! I was able to make changes locally, and then commit the amende file to my github repo


SUCCESS AGAIN! I was able to pull this down from my github account using the following sequence:
Git fetch
git init
git status.. This told me that my branch was behind by 1 commit and and can be fast forwarded (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
Did git pull
Showed me the new file! 

Now I am going to try to upload this to my github repo again and see how it goes.
